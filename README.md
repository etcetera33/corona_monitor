The main purpose of the code in `Main` is to dynamically calculate the falsification indexes in the COVID-19 lethal cases.
The algorithm takes into account a difference in various countries, their population, countries' medical histories, health care index, etc. 

### Note!
The algorithms with falsification calculation are rather hard as is this one.

<br> The main purpose of this study is to get the number of lethal cases that might have been missed as COVID-19 times are rather difficult
for medical systems, so the burden on them might have caused the difference between official numbers and actual numbers.
